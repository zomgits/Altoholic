*	Altaholic for Vanilla WoW: Change Log							   *
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.9
	- RightClick menus fixed - root cause: renamed frames from previous release

	- Re-origanized addon files
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.8
	- Renamed all frames to something less generic to avoid global collisions. The recent fix
	  for the addon "Mail" wasn't enough.
	
	- Fixed an event issue where a function was clearing characters bank cache upon close.
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.7
	- Fixed an invalid method error while using Altaholic with the addon "Mail". The framename
	  the original author used ("Mail") was too generic and caused a conflict. Changed the
	  framename to ("AltoMail") to avoid this conflict.
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.6
	- Fixed an issue with the Bag Usage menu not updating the bags size correctly after
	  upgrading/changing a bag slot.

	- Fixed an issue with E-Mails getting marked as read when a player opens their mailbox.
	  This causes all items in the mailbox to go from (30 to X-num of days left) to 3 days
	  remaining. The Altoholic option [Scan mail body (marks it as read)] was broken.
	  Changed the default to "off (unchecked" and fixed the toggle.

	- During one of my code clean-ups I inadvertanly removed my "UIDropDownMenu_CreateInfo"
	  code shim. Originally this API didn't exsist in Vanilla WoW but does in BC. Cartographer
	  has a simular shim so this issue was missed in testing before the latest release. This
	  has been fixed and if you have Cartographer or not, this should no longer spam the player
	  with errors.
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.5
	- Added ChatLink support. Questlinks will inform you which Alts have the quest. Itemlinks
	  will inform you where the item is dropped if it’s gear. If it’s a consumable or any other
	  type of item you can use it will tell you how many you have and which Alts have them. In
	  some cases, it will tell you if an item is a crafted item. “Item Source” can be toggled
	  on/off in the Options panel.

	- Speaking of “…how many you have…”. Item counts! Yes, hover over a piece of Wool, a
	  Bandage, or a healing potion etc. The tooltip will inform you which Alts have it, how
	  much, and tell you if it’s in the Alt’s bank or bags. “Item Source, Item Count Per
	  Character, and Total Item Count” can be toggled on/off in the Options panel.

	- Options… both “Already Known” and “Learnable By…” were at one point combined into one
	  on/off switch. Now, they are separated and can be toggled separately. By default,
	  “Include Already Known” is off and “Include Learnable By” is on. Makes for a cleaner
	  tooltip as there is already a flood of info going to it.

	- All tooltips are now processed not just inside Altaholic but now outside and information
	  is available from Player Bank and Bags, the Mailbox, Auction House, and Chat frames.
***************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.4
	- The OnClick function in the XML - the values were reversed (BC method)

	- Cleaned up other OnClick, OnShow, OnEnter functions
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.3
	- Fixed the Consumable's and Trade Goods search sections. There are no sub-categories for
	  these types of items. Basically, works the same way the Auction House search works. This
	  wasn't available until BC.

	- Fixed a memory leak. I found a few more functions with bugs in them that was inserting [0]
	  keys into tables and then polluting the Saved Variables file which can cause other
	  functions to not find what they are looking for. These were also not getting cleared
	  properly which caused all the cache tables to grow over time. I’ve also inserted some
	  code that will scrub for [0] keys incase I missed some sub-routines.

	- Tooltips will now notify the player when and which characters trade skill database is
	  empty. It’s also now smart enough to know if a character has a particular trade skill.
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.2
	- Narrowed the the tooltip checker to only include the mailbox, auction house and bag
	  tooltips so we aren't hooking tooltips we don't need to read.

	- Recipe checker now checks Class Books and Recipes.
****************************************************************************************************
	v1.0.1
	- Added some screenshots

	- Fixed double tooltip issues when other addons are present

	- Expanded some tooltip features to include some additional frames
